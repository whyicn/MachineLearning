\chapter{Modeling}

\section{Select Modeling Tecnique}

\subsection{Modeling Technique}
% Document the modeling technique that youâ€™ll be using

\subsection{Modeling Assumptions}
% Record any assumptions about the data that are necessary for the modeling techniques



\section{Generate Test Design}

\subsection{Test Design}
% Describe how to divide the available dataset into training, test and validation datasets


\section{Build Model}

\subsection{Parameter Settings}
% With any modeling tool there are often a large number of parameters that can be adjusted

% List the parameters and their chosen values

\subsection{Models}
% The actual models produced by the modeling tool

\subsection{Model Description}
% Describe the resultant models



\section{Assess Model}

\subsection{Model Assessment}
% List the qualities of your generated models and rank their quality in relation to each other


\subsection{Revised Parameter Settings}
% According to the model assessment, revise parameter settings and tune them for the next modeling run

% Iterate until you strongly believe that you have found the best models
